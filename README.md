# FEC Filing Skill for Claude Code

A Claude Code Agent Skill for analyzing Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance filings.

> **Note:** This skill requires local network access to fetch data from the FEC API (`docquery.fec.gov`). It works with [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) running locally, but not in Claude's web environment where external API access is restricted.

## Features

- Fetch and analyze FEC filings by filing ID
- Support for all major form types (F1, F2, F3, F99)
- Detailed field mappings for contributions, disbursements, and schedules
- Auto-installing dependencies via uv

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for running the fetch script)
- Python 3.9+

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone this repository (Project Skill)

```bash
git clone <repo-url> fec-skill
cd fec-skill
```

The skill is automatically available when using Claude Code in this directory.

### Option 2: Install as a Personal Skill

Copy the skill to your personal skills directory:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> /tmp/fec-skill
cp -r /tmp/fec-skill/.claude/skills/fec-filing ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill is now available globally in all Claude Code sessions.

### Option 3: Add to an Existing Project

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/skills
cp -r .claude/skills/fec-filing your-project/.claude/skills/
```

## Usage

Once installed, ask Claude Code to analyze FEC filings:

- "Tell me about the committee for FEC 1896830"

```
