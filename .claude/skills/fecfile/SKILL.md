# FEC Filing Analysis

This skill enables analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign finance filings.

## Requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) must be installed
- Python 3.9+

Dependencies are automatically installed when running the script with `uv run`.

## Quick Start

To analyze an FEC filing, use the helper script:

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/fecfile/scripts/fetch_filing.py <FILING_ID>
```

Example:
```bash
uv run .claude/skills/fecfile/scripts/fetch_filing.py 1896830
```

The `fecfile` library and other dependencies are installed automatically by uv.

## Finding Filing IDs

Filing IDs can be found via:
1. **FEC Website**: Visit [fec.gov](https://www.fec.gov) and search for a committee
2. **Direct URLs**: Filing IDs appear in URLs like `https://docquery.fec.gov/dcdev/posted/1690664.fec`
3. **FEC API**: Use the [FEC API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/) to search for filings

## Response Style

When analyzing FEC filings:
- Start with your best judgment about whether this filing has unusual aspects (no activity is not unusual)
- Write in a simple, direct style
- Group related information together in coherent sections
- Avoid excessive formatting or bold text

## Form Types

See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for detailed guidance on:
- **F1/F1A**: Committee registration/organization
- **F2/F2A**: Candidate declarations
- **F3/F3P/F3X**: Financial reports
- **F99**: Miscellaneous text filings

## Schedules & Field Mappings

See [SCHEDULES.md](SCHEDULES.md) for detailed field mappings for:
- **Schedule A**: Individual contributions
- **Schedule B**: Disbursements/expenditures
- **Schedule C**: Loans
- **Schedule D**: Debts
- **Schedule E**: Independent expenditures

## Amendment Detection

Check the `amendment_indicator` field:
- `A` = Standard Amendment
- `T` = Termination Amendment
- Empty/None = Original Filing

If it's an amendment, look for `previous_report_amendment_indicator` for the original filing ID.

## Coverage Periods

Use `coverage_from_date` and `coverage_through_date` fields.
- Format: Usually YYYY-MM-DD
- Calculate days covered: (end_date - start_date) + 1
- Context: Quarterly reports ~90 days, Monthly ~30 days, Pre-election varies

## Financial Summary Fields

For financial filings (F3, F3P, F3X):
- **Receipts**: `col_a_total_receipts`
- **Disbursements**: `col_a_total_disbursements`
- **Cash on Hand**: `col_a_cash_on_hand_close_of_period`
- **Debts**: `col_a_debts_to` and `col_a_debts_by`

## Data Quality Notes

- Contributions/expenditures $200+ must be itemized with details
- Smaller amounts may appear in summary totals but not itemized
- FEC Committee ID format is usually C########

## Example Queries

Once you have filing data, you can answer questions like:
- "What are the total receipts and disbursements?"
- "Who are the top 10 contributors?"
- "What are the largest expenditures?"
- "What contributions came from California?"
- "How much was spent on advertising?"
