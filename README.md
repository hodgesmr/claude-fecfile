# FEC Filing Agent Skill

An [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) for analyzing Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance filings.

This skill was originally ported from Derek Willis's [llm-fecfile](https://github.com/dwillis/llm-fecfile), an LLM plugin that provides FEC filing analysis as fragments for Simon Willison's [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) CLI tool. The core functionality and field mapping guidance have been adapted into the Agent Skill format, making FEC data analysis available directly within agent sessions. I wrote about that initial process [here](https://matthodges.com/posts/2025-12-19-ai-agent-fec/).

> [!NOTE]
> This Skill requires local network access to fetch data from the FEC (`docquery.fec.gov`). It will not work in environments where external network access is restricted.

## Features

- Fetch and analyze FEC filings by filing ID
- Support for major form types (F1, F2, F3, F99)
- Detailed field mappings for contributions, disbursements, and schedules
- Auto-installing dependencies via uv

## Requirements

- An agent runtime that supports Agent Skills (e.g., [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/))
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for running the fetch script)
- Python 3.9+

## Installation (Global)

Clone the repository and copy the skill into your runtime's skills directory.

```bash
git clone --branch latest git@github.com:hodgesmr/agent-fecfile.git ~/agent-fecfile
```

**Copy to your runtime's skills directory:**
```bash
# Claude Code CLI
cp -r ~/agent-fecfile/skills/fecfile ~/.claude/skills/fecfile

# Codex CLI
cp -r ~/agent-fecfile/skills/fecfile ~/.codex/skills/fecfile
```

Replace the target path with your runtime's skill directory as needed.

## Updating

Pull the latest changes and re-copy:
```bash
cd ~/agent-fecfile && git fetch && git checkout latest
```

Then re-run the copy command for your runtime:
```bash
# Claude Code CLI
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/fecfile && cp -r ~/agent-fecfile/skills/fecfile ~/.claude/skills/fecfile

# Codex CLI
rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/fecfile && cp -r ~/agent-fecfile/skills/fecfile ~/.codex/skills/fecfile
```

To pin a specific version instead:
```bash
cd ~/agent-fecfile && git fetch && git checkout 1.0.0
# Then re-run the copy command above
```

## Usage

Once installed, ask your agent to analyze FEC filings:

> [!WARNING]
> FEC filings should be considered [untrusted content](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/). A malicious campaign sneaking prompt injections into the memo text field of their F99 is probably unlikely, but not impossible.
